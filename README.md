# Diamond Price Prediction | Machine Learning Project

## Aim:

The aim of this project is to create a machine learning model for predicting diamond prices based on relevant features. This README file will guide you through the steps to set up the project environment, execute the code, and understand the structure of the project.

## Steps to Follow:

### 1. Create a Virtual Environment:

Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system. Open a terminal and run the following command:

```bash
python3 -m venv dpp_venv
```

### 2. Activate the Virtual Environment:

For Linux OS:

```bash
source dpp_venv/bin/activate
```

For Windows OS:

```bash
.\dpp_venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Required Packages:

While your virtual environment is activated, install the necessary packages from the provided `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all the required libraries and dependencies for the project.

### Project Structure:

The project is structured as follows:

- **`data/`**: Directory to store the dataset (e.g., `diamond_data.csv`).
- **`src/`**: Contains the source code for the machine learning model.
  - **`preprocess.py`**: Code for data preprocessing.
  - **`train.py`**: Code for training the machine learning model.
  - **`predict.py`**: Code for making predictions using the trained model.
- **`models/`**: Directory to store the trained machine learning model.
- **`requirements.txt`**: List of Python packages required for the project.
- **`README.md`**: Project documentation.

### How to Run:

1. Place your diamond dataset in the `data/` directory (e.g., `diamond_data.csv`).
2. Open a terminal and activate the virtual environment:

    ```bash
    source dpp_venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. Navigate to the `src/` directory:

    ```bash
    cd src
    ```

4. Run the data preprocessing script:

    ```bash
    python preprocess.py
    ```

5. Train the machine learning model:

    ```bash
    python train.py
    ```

6. Make predictions using the trained model:

    ```bash
    python predict.py
    ```

### Note:

- Ensure your dataset is appropriately formatted and placed in the `data/` directory.
- Adjust the code in `preprocess.py` and `train.py` based on the specifics of your dataset and machine learning approach.
- This is a basic template, and you may need to customize it further based on the nuances of your diamond price prediction task.
